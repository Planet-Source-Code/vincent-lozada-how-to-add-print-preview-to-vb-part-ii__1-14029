### Description

I started this project nearly a year ago to provide printing and print-previewing in my applications. This project has a lot of room for improvement, so my hope is that you can take this project and run with it for I have limited time to develop it any further.

The project has two dependencies: SSubtmr.dll and Win.tlb (large file). When you un-zip the file, please pay close attention to these dependencies in order to make the project work. Credit goes to Steve McMahon and Bruce McKinney for these libraries.
